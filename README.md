SMPTE ST 2133: Job Processing Architecture – Public Committee Draft (Public CD)

This material is work under development and shall not be referred to as a SMPTE Standard, Recommended Practice, or Engineering Guideline. It is distributed for review and comment; distribution does not constitute publication.

We are pleased to announce the entry of SMPTE ST 2133 (Job Processing Architecture) into SMPTE’s Public Committee Draft (PCD) status. Putting this into PCD status allows the industry access to the document for the purpose of testing it out, building implementations, and providing feedback to the 34CS Media Microservices Drafting Group on it before proceeding further.

This document has proceeded through the SMPTE approval process up to the point of pre-Final Committee Draft review. It defines an API that provides a standardized framework, allowing the grouping of related services into reuseable units of work that can be instantiated as “jobs”.

It builds upon the work of other initiatives, especially the European Broadcasting Union’s Media Cloud and Microservices (EBU’s MCMA) group. This document ultimately lays the groundwork for future work that is anticipated in the area of a Global Service Repository.
